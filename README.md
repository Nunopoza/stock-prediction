# Quantitative Finance Project Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of projects focused on core areas of **Quantitative Finance**, developed to demonstrate practical skills in algorithmic trading, risk management, and financial modeling. All projects are designed as independent modules, but together they build a robust foundation for quantitative strategy development and testing.

## Projects Overview

### 1️⃣ Backtesting Framework for Trading Strategies
- Objective: Implement a flexible and modular backtesting engine to evaluate various trading strategies under realistic market conditions.
- Features:
    - Historical and synthetic data testing.
    - Performance metrics: Sharpe Ratio, Maximum Drawdown, PnL, Alpha, Beta.
    - Example strategies: Moving Average Crossover, Momentum, Mean-Reversion.

### 2️⃣ Volatility Forecasting & Value-at-Risk (VaR) Modeling
- Objective: Forecast market volatility and estimate Value-at-Risk using statistical models.
- Features:
    - Volatility models: Historical Volatility, GARCH family.
    - VaR estimation: Historical Simulation, Parametric VaR, GARCH-based VaR.
    - Backtesting of VaR using Kupiec and Christoffersen tests.

### 3️⃣ Execution Algorithms
- Objective: Simulate the execution of trading orders considering market microstructure.
- Features:
    - Implementation of classical execution algorithms: TWAP, VWAP, POV.
    - Study of slippage, market impact, and transaction costs.
    - Comparative analysis of execution efficiency.

### 4️⃣ Statistical Arbitrage
- Objective: Develop and evaluate a statistical arbitrage framework.
- Features:
    - Pair selection via cointegration tests.
    - Design of mean-reversion strategies (pairs trading).
    - Performance analysis and risk management.

## Planned Tests & Experiments

Each module will include:
- Simulated and historical market scenarios.
- Evaluation of model robustness under different volatility regimes.
- Sensitivity analysis to key parameters.
- Benchmark comparison with naive strategies.
- Risk-adjusted performance evaluation.
- Visualization of results and strategy diagnostics.
